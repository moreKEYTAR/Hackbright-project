### Summary
SamePage provides lightweight kanban project management through simple, virtual pinboards. A user can be a member of several teams, navigating between team boards to “opt in” and claim action items, or post new ideas for teammates to upvote. Teammates see all pending tasks at a glance, as well as click into any of their pending action items to update notes or mark as completed.

Email API integration allows users to invite new contributors, and data visualizations provide user and team data insights. Using drag and drop kinetics, the app is intuitive and easy to use for personal projects, planning events with friends, or keeping a professional team on the same page.
